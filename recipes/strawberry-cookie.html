<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Strawberry Cookies are a fun,festive, and <strong>SUPER SIMPLE</strong> way to add some pizazz to the table. The Strawberry cake mix with the white chocolate combination is <strong>UNDEFEATED.</strong></p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 box Strawberry Cake mix</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup white chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the cake mix and baking powder. combined.</li>
    <li>In a separate smaller bowl, whisk the eggs, oil, and vanilla together by hand. Whisk until well. Pour the egg mixture into the bowl with cake mix and stir with a spoon until a dough forms. Be sure to fully combine. Mix in the white chocolate chips.</li>
    <li>Using a small portion scoop, drop rounded balls of the dough onto your baking sheet. These cookies flatten out quite a bit, so make sure the balls are taller than they are wide, and give them quite a bit of space between each cookie.</li>
    <li>Bake for 9-10 minutes. Do not let them brown in the oven. They will appear slightly undercooked, but that is a good thing. They will firm up and flatten as they cool. When you take them out, you can add a couple more white chocolate chips to the top to make them look pretty </li>
    <li>Allow to cool for at least 10 minutes</li>
